![Human-Centered Design Process](img/hci_banner.png)

<!--
For computer scientists, the word _design_ is too often used exclusively in the context of code and architecture. The result of this narrow perspective is that engineers have a habit of building complex, intricate products that are wonderfully functional, but never used. When they _are_ used, neglecting people in your design can lead to unexpected consequences that range from clumsiness to discrimination for individuals, groups, or cultures.

In this course, we will study both people and technology to  understand the behavior that computers encourage or constrain. Through a variety of modalities (3D user interfaces, visualization, coding playgrounds, etc), we will deliberately practice processes that result in useful, usable, and maybe even inspirational computer interfaces.
